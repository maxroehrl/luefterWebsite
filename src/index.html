            <p>
              ... ist die Firma "Vario-Vent Lüftungssysteme GmbH" insolvent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Grundlegend war die Idee des Unternehmens klasse:
              Einfach zu montierende Lüfter, die ganz ohne aufwendige Verkabelung auskommen.
              Das Ganze als smarte Lösung im schlichten Design arrangiert.
              <br><br>
              Viele der von dieser Firma entwickelten Anlagen geben leider nun jedoch nach und nach den Geist auf.
              Meist sind die eigentlichen Lüftungsanlagen sogar technisch in gutem Zustand und könnten noch Jahre
              weiterlaufen.
              Das Problem liegt hierbei oft beim Steuerorgan des Systems, dem sogenannten Spot.
              Wegen der Insolvenz des Unternehmens bietet dieses jedoch keinerlei Reparatur-Service für die Anlagen mehr
              an.
            </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            In vielen Fällen ist die SD-Karte oder ein Hardware-Defekt beim Spot die Ursache für den plötzlichen
            Systemausfall.
            Doch keine Sorge in den meisten Fällen lässt sich dieses Problem lösen.
            Der Spot lässt sich relativ einfach demontieren und kann per Paket bei uns eingeschickt werden.
          </p>
          <br>
          <strong>Reparaturmöglichkeiten am Spot</strong>:

        <h3><strong>Sensor-Reparatur</strong><br></h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            Jede Variante der VarioVent-Lüfter verfügt über ein Sensor-System zum Bestimmen der Temperatur oder der
            Luftfeuchtigkeit.
            Durch diverse Umwelt-Einflüsse kann es dazu kommen, dass diese Sensoren oder die Platine korrodieren.
            Dies kann nicht nur zu einem Ausfall des Sensors, sondern sogar zum Totalausfall des Lüfters führen.
          </p>
          <br>
          <strong>Wir bieten Reparaturen oder Ersatz für folgende Sensoren an:</strong>
          <ul class="ul-check list-unstyled success">
            <li>X-Serie</li>
            <li>DuoLive</li>

        <h3><strong>Austausch</strong></h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            Manche Kunden wünschen den Austausch des Systems gegen eine simplere Lösung.
            Hierfür haben wir sowohl für die X-Serie als auch für die DuoLive-Variante Platinen entwickelt,
            die komplett ohne Funksystem arbeiten und das dauerhafte Einstellen einer Lüftungsstufe per Drehknopf
            ermöglichen.
            Je nach Bedarf kann auch ein Pendel-Betrieb ermöglicht werden.
            Dies ist besonders für Lüfter im Einzelbetrieb interessant, welche bei Bädern oder WCs verbaut sind.

        <h3><strong>Wandadapter</strong></h3>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="text-justify">
            Die Unterbringung der Spots am Lüftungsgerät ist in vielen Fällen keine zufriedenstellende Lösung.
            Wir haben deshalb eine kompakte Adapterlösung entwickelt.
            Diese wird per 3D-Druck hergestellt und ermöglicht Ihnen eine bessere Positionierbarkeit des Spots!
            Außerdem ist so ein Betrieb per USB-Netzteil einfach realisierbar,
            welches im Notfall einfach ausgetauscht werden kann.

        <h3>Ich habe keine einschlägige Erfahrung mit Elektronik. Ist ein Selbstausbau der Lüfter sinnvoll?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Elektronische Spannung und die damit verbundenen Gefahren sollten nicht unterschätzt werden.
          Kontaktieren Sie eine Fachkraft, die die Umbaumaßnahmen für Sie übernimmt.
          Dies kann eine Lüftungstechnik- oder Elektrotechnik-Firma für Sie übernehmen.
          <br>ACHTUNG: Wir haften für keinerlei Schäden bei Personen oder Objekten, die in Folge der untenbeschriebenen Maßnahmen entstehen!

        <h3>Die Status-LEDs meines Spots leuchten nicht mehr. Was kann hier kaputt sein?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Üblicherweise ist in diesem Fall die Hauptplatine oder das Netzteil defekt und muss entsprechend ausgetauscht werden.
          Um einen Defekt am Netzteil auszuschließen, sollte mit einem Multimeter die Spannung an den Zuleitungen des Spots messen.
          Mittels eines Mikro-USB-Netzteils kann die Funktion des Spots getestet werden.
          <br>ACHTUNG: Hierfür müssen die Zuleitungen der Spannungsversorgung abgeklemmt werden!
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="service">
        <h3>Mein Spot ist nicht mehr per WLAN erreichbar. Wie kann ich wieder auf diesen zugreifen?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Das Fehlen des WLANs kann mehrere Gründe haben. Überprüfen Sie den WLAN-Stick, ob dieser eventuell heiß ist.
          Ist dies nicht der Fall testen Sie den WLAN-Stick an einem PC oder Laptop.
          Im Normalfall leuchtet oder blinkt der Stick mit blauem Licht.
          <br>ACHTUNG: Das Testen des Sticks kann zu Defekten am Computer führen..
          <br>Falls die Status-LEDs der Hauptplatine leuchten, kann eventuell eine Verbindung per Ethernet aufgebaut werden.
          Ein blinken der grünen LED deutet auf ein Funktionieren der SD-Karte hin.
          Im umgekehrten Fall ist die SD defekt und muss ausgetauscht werden!

        <h3>Mein Lüfter hat einen Sensor-Fehler. Wie kann ich diesen beheben?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Oft ist Verschmutzung oder Oxidation der Leiterplatte die Ursache für einen Fehler.
          Im einfachsten Fall kann ein Reinigen mit Platinenreiniger Abhilfe verschaffen.
          Meist sind die Sensoren jedoch durch die Verschmutzung gänzlich zerstört worden.
          Schicken Sie die Sensoren zu uns ein und wir tauschen oder reparieren diese für Sie!

        <h3>Ein Lüfter ist nicht mehr erreichbar. Wie bekomme ich diesen wieder zum Lüften?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Um eine fehlerhafte Funkverbindung auszuschließen,
          sollten Sie zunächst einen Neuberechnung der Route über das Webinterface anstoßen!
          Schlägt auch dies fehl, liegt mit hoher Gewissheit ein Hardware-Defekt vor.
          Hierbei kann beispielsweise das Netzteil des Lüfters defekt oder die Sensor-Platine einen Kurzschluss verursachen.
          Ein Testen der Lüfterplatine an einem anderen Gerät bzw. Netzteil kann hierbei für Klarheit sorgen.

        <h3>Ich möchte Teile bei Spot-Repair einschicken. Wie muss ich dies machen?</h3>
        <div class="content">
          Verpacken Sie die Komponenten sorgfältig und sicher.
          Es empfiehlt sich bei Platinen eine ESD- oder Alufolie zum Einwickeln zu verwenden!
          Nicht ESD-fähige Folien können leicht zu Hardware-Defekten führen.
          Versenden Sie das Paket an uns IMMER mit Sendeverfolgung und unter Angabe unserer E-Mail-Adresse!
